## Project Overview

The **Isar App** is a real-world iOS application developed as part of a product team.  
I contributed as a **React Native Developer**, focusing on **performance**, **clean architecture**, and **UI consistency**.  
The app is live, actively used, and maintained through a structured development process under guidance from a team lead.

---

## Technology Stack

- **React Native (iOS-focused):** Core framework for Apple devices, delivering native-like performance and smooth UX.
- **TypeScript:** Strong typing across the codebase to reduce runtime errors and improve maintainability.
- **React Navigation:** Ensured consistent and intuitive navigation between screens.
- **Expo:** Streamlined development and simplified iOS deployment.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Enforced clean and consistent code via pre-commit hooks.

---

## Development Highlights

- Worked within an agile team, implementing features and improvements via assigned tickets.
- Built **modular UI components** and **reusable hooks** for scalability.
- Followed best practices for **version control**, **code review**, and **linting**.
- Performed **regular testing on real devices** to ensure stability and user satisfaction.

> In this project, I worked on an iOS app in a product team. The hard parts were adding a React calendar, making sorting work well, and optimizing images, text, and PDFs so file size was smaller. I solved these with React Native tools, custom hooks, and good optimization practices.
