## Project Overview

The **Todo List Application** is a simple productivity tool where users can add, delete, and manage their tasks.
It has a clean design, works smoothly on any device, and saves tasks so they stay even after reloading the page.

---

## Technology Stack

- **React + TypeScript:** Strongly typed component-based architecture for reliability and maintainability.
- **Vite:** Fast development server and build tool.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling for responsive and modern design.
- **localStorage:** Lightweight client-side persistence for tasks.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Ensured clean, consistent, and high-quality code.

---

## Development Highlights

- Built **task management features**: add, delete, toggle complete, and filter todos.
- Implemented **persistent storage** with localStorage so tasks remain after page reloads.
- Applied **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useReducer`) for state and performance optimizations.
- Designed a **responsive UI** with Tailwind CSS, ensuring smooth usability across devices.
- Structured the code with **modular components** for clarity and scalability.

> In this project, I built a todo app with filters, storage, and a clean UI. The difficult part was using React hooks like useMemo and useReducer for state and performance. I solved this by learning how to manage state better and making the app faster with memoization.
