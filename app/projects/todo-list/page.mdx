## Project Overview

The **Todo List Application** is a simple yet powerful productivity tool that allows users to **add, delete, filter, and manage daily tasks**.  
The app is designed with a focus on **clean UI**, **state management**, and **performance optimization**, showcasing modern frontend development practices.

Users can filter tasks (all, completed, active), toggle completion status, and persist their list across sessions using browser storage.

---

## Technology Stack

- **React + TypeScript:** Strongly typed component-based architecture for reliability and maintainability.
- **Vite:** Fast development server and build tool.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling for responsive and modern design.
- **localStorage:** Lightweight client-side persistence for tasks.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Ensured clean, consistent, and high-quality code.

---

## Development Highlights

- Built **task management features**: add, delete, toggle complete, and filter todos.
- Implemented **persistent storage** with localStorage so tasks remain after page reloads.
- Applied **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useReducer`) for state and performance optimizations.
- Designed a **responsive UI** with Tailwind CSS, ensuring smooth usability across devices.
- Structured the code with **modular components** for clarity and scalability.

> In this project, I built a todo app with filters, storage, and a clean UI. The difficult part was using React hooks like useMemo and useReducer for state and performance. I solved this by learning how to manage state better and making the app faster with memoization.
