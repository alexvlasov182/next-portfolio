# Todo List Application

**Author:** Oleksandr Vlasov  
**Role:** React Developer  
**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, localStorage, ESLint, Prettier

## Project Overview

The **Todo List Application** is a simple yet powerful productivity tool that allows users to **add, edit, filter, and manage daily tasks**.  
The app is designed with a focus on **clean UI**, **state management**, and **performance optimization**, showcasing modern frontend development practices.  

Users can filter tasks (all, completed, active), toggle completion status, and persist their list across sessions using browser storage.

## Technology Stack

- **React + TypeScript:** Strongly typed component-based architecture for reliability and maintainability.  
- **Vite:** Fast development server and build tool.  
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling for responsive and modern design.  
- **localStorage:** Lightweight client-side persistence for tasks.  
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Ensured clean, consistent, and high-quality code.

## Development Highlights

- Built **task management features**: add, delete, toggle complete, and filter todos.  
- Implemented **persistent storage** with localStorage so tasks remain after page reloads.  
- Applied **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useReducer`) for state and performance optimizations.  
- Designed a **responsive UI** with Tailwind CSS, ensuring smooth usability across devices.  
- Structured the code with **modular components** for clarity and scalability.
