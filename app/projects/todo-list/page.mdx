# ToDo App – React + TypeScript Project

This is a **full-featured ToDo application** built with **React** and **TypeScript**, designed to demonstrate clean architecture, state management, performance optimizations, and modern frontend practices.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **React** – For building the UI components.
- **TypeScript** – Strong typing for safer and more predictable code.
- **React Hooks** – `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useEffect` for state and performance management.
- **React Context API** – For global theme management (light/dark mode).
- **localStorage** – Persist todos and user-selected theme across sessions.
- **Vite** – Fast development and build tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling with utility-first classes (optional, can be replaced with CSS modules).
- **React.memo** – Component memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Custom Hooks** – Example: `useLocalStorage` for syncing state with localStorage.
- **Deployment** – Hosted on Vercel or Netlify for instant global availability.

## **Project Architecture**

```bash
src/
components/
TodoInput.tsx // Input field and add button
TodoList.tsx // List of todo items
TodoItem.tsx // Single todo item component
Filters.tsx // Filter buttons (All, Active, Completed)
ThemeToggle.tsx // Light/Dark theme switcher
contexts/
ThemeContext.tsx // Theme context provider
reducers/
todoReducer.ts // Handles ADD, REMOVE, TOGGLE actions
hooks/
useLocalStorage.ts // Custom hook for syncing state with localStorage
types/
todo.ts // TypeScript types for Todo and Filter
App.tsx // Main app 
```


- **Components** handle UI only, keeping logic separate.
- **Reducers** centralize state logic (`useReducer`) for predictability.
- **Context** provides theme globally, with automatic re-rendering on changes.
- **Hooks** abstract repeated logic and enable performance optimizations.

---

## **Key Features**

### 1. **State Management with useReducer**
- Complex state (add, toggle, remove todos) is centralized in a reducer.
- Predictable and easy to test.

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- `useCallback` for event handlers (`onAdd`, `onToggle`, `onRemove`) to avoid unnecessary renders.
- `useMemo` for filtered todos (`all`, `active`, `completed`) to avoid expensive recalculations.
- `React.memo` for `TodoItem` and `TodoList`.

### 3. **Theme Switcher**
- Light/dark mode stored in **ThemeContext**.
- Persists user selection in `localStorage`.
- Applied globally via `document.documentElement` class.

### 4. **Persistence with localStorage**
- Todos and theme are persisted across browser reloads.
- Lazy initialization for efficient initial state loading.

### 5. **Filters**
- Filter state lifted to parent component.
- `useMemo` returns filtered todos to reduce computation and improve performance.

---

## **Deployment**

- **Vercel/Netlify** for hosting.
- Production build: `npm run build`.
- Instant deployment with CI/CD.
- Accessible globally with HTTPS.

---

## **Why This Project?**

- Demonstrates **clean code architecture**.
- Shows advanced **React hooks usage**.
- Optimized rendering techniques (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).
- Implements **persistent state** with localStorage.
- Supports **modern UI/UX** with theme switching and filters.
- Ready for real-world **portfolio presentation**.

This ToDo app is not just functional but also a showcase of **best practices in modern React development**, including **performance, maintainability, and deployment**.
