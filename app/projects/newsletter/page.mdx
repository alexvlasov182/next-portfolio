> In this project, I built a responsive newsletter page with a working subscription form. The hard part was making the form and content work fast and smooth on all devices. I solved this by using Next.js server-side rendering, adding form validation, and using Framer Motion and Swiper for animations. I also improved accessibility and code quality with ESLint, Prettier, and Tailwind CSS
