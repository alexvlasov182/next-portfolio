## Project Overview

The **RoyalZSoftware Course Marketplace** is a modern e-learning platform (similar to Udemy) where users can **buy and watch courses**.  
I developed the platform with a focus on **scalability**, **clean architecture**, and **user experience**, combining a fast frontend with a robust backend.

The marketplace supports secure payments, seamless video streaming, and intuitive course browsing, providing a complete end-to-end learning solution.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js + TypeScript:** Frontend framework for fast, SEO-friendly pages with strong typing.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling for responsive, modern UI design.
- **Node.js + PostgreSQL:** Backend and database powering course data, users, and transactions.
- **Stripe:** Secure and reliable payment processing for course purchases.
- **Mux:** High-quality video streaming for smooth course playback.
- **Docker:** Containerized services for easy deployment and scalability.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Enforced clean, consistent, high-quality code.

---

## Development Highlights

- Designed a **course marketplace flow** from browsing to checkout and playback.
- Integrated **Stripe Checkout** for one-time payments.
- Implemented **Mux video hosting & streaming** for high-performance video delivery.
- Applied **clean architecture** principles with modular components and reusable hooks.
- Used **Dockerized setup** for consistent local and production environments.

> In this project, I built a course marketplace with payments and video streaming. The hard part was setting up Mux for video, connecting it with Next.js and the database, and running everything with Docker. I solved this by careful integration of Mux, PostgreSQL, and containerized services.
