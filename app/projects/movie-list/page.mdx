## Project Overview

The **Movie List App** is a web application where users can filter, watchlist toggle, and browse movies using real TMDB data.
It has a clean, responsive design and lets users view details and manage a watchlist with a smooth, easy-to-use experience.

---

## Technology Stack

- **React + TypeScript:** Strongly typed, component-based architecture.
- **React Query (TanStack Query):** Data fetching, caching, and state synchronization.
- **Axios:** API client for TMDB requests.
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui:** Modern, responsive, and accessible UI components.
- **Vite:** Fast development and build tooling.
- **TMDB API:** Provides real movie data (popular, search, details).
- **Vercel:** Deployment and hosting.

---

## Development Highlights

- Implemented **movie list, filters, and watchlist toggle** with optimistic updates.
- Designed **responsive movie cards and detail pages** optimized for mobile and desktop.
- Built **custom hooks** (`usePopularMovies`, `useMovieDetails`, `useSearchMovies`, `useToggleWatch`) for clean data logic.
- Structured the app with **modular components** for maintainability and scalability.
- Focused on **performance** and **UX** with React Query caching and background updates.

> In this project, I built a movie app with filters, and a watchlist. The difficult part was learning optimistic updates and using useMutation with onMutate in React Query. I solved this by testing different cases until the watchlist worked fast with instant feedback.
