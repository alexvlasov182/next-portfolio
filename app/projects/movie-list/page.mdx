# Movie Explorer Application

**Author:** Oleksandr Vlasov  
**Role:** Frontend Developer  
**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, React Query, Axios, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vite, TMDB API, Vercel  

---

## Project Overview

The **Movie Explorer App** is a modern web application that allows users to **search, filter, and browse movies** using real data from the TMDB API.  
It was built with a focus on **clean architecture**, **responsive design**, and **smooth user experience**, showcasing advanced frontend development practices.  

Users can explore popular movies, view detailed pages with full information, and manage a personal watchlist with instant feedback powered by optimistic updates.

## Technology Stack

- **React + TypeScript:** Strongly typed, component-based architecture.  
- **React Query (TanStack Query):** Data fetching, caching, and state synchronization.  
- **Axios:** API client for TMDB requests.  
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui:** Modern, responsive, and accessible UI components.  
- **Vite:** Fast development and build tooling.  
- **TMDB API:** Provides real movie data (popular, search, details).  
- **Vercel:** Deployment and hosting.

## Development Highlights

- Implemented **movie search, filters, and watchlist toggle** with optimistic updates.  
- Designed **responsive movie cards and detail pages** optimized for mobile and desktop.  
- Built **custom hooks** (`usePopularMovies`, `useMovieDetails`, `useSearchMovies`, `useToggleWatch`) for clean data logic.  
- Structured the app with **modular components** for maintainability and scalability.  
- Focused on **performance** and **UX** with React Query caching and background updates.
