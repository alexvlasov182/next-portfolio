# Building a Web Server in Go

I built a **minimal web server** in **Go** using the standard library. The server responds at `/` with request details and has a `/count` endpoint to track the number of requests.

The difficult part was handling **concurrent requests safely** using `sync.Mutex` and managing request counts correctly.

This project helped me understand **Go basics**, **HTTP handlers**, and **concurrency**, giving a practical introduction to building web servers from scratch.

For the full project and code, check the post link above.
