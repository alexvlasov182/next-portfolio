As a junior React developer, I recently worked on a project to build a **Todo** **Application** using **React** with **TypeScript**. The goal was to build a functional app and dive deeper into React features like **useState**, **useMemo**, and especially **useContext** for state management.

This app allows users to add, delete, mark tasks as complete, and even download the to-do list as a CSV file.

# **1\. Setting Up the Project with Vite**

First, I used Vite to create my project. Vite is a great tool for fast and efficient React development. Here’s how I set it up:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-todo-app --template react-ts
```

This gave me a **TypeScript**\-ready React project right from the start.

# **2\. Managing Todos with** `useState`

The core feature of this app is the **to**\-**do** **list** itself. I used React **useState** to manage the list of todos. Each to-do has two properties: the **task** **description** and whether it’s **completed**.

Here’s what the todo type looks like in TypeScript:

```typescript
export interface Todo = {
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
};
```

To manage the state, I used **useState**:

```typescript
const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([])
```

This allows me to add new todos, mark them as completed, or delete them.

# **3\. Avoiding Prop Drilling with useContext**

Passing down props through multiple components can get messy quickly, especially when the app grows. Instead of passing the to-do list and functions through several layers, I used **React** **Context.**

- **createContext**: This sets up a "global store" for the todo state and functions like **addTodo**, **deleteTodo**, and **toggleTodo**.
- **useContext**: Any component that needs access to this store can **useContext** to easily access the todo state and functions.

This simplified my app and made it much easier to manage the to-do list of different components.

Here’s how I set up the context:

```typescript
const TodoContext = createContext<TodoContextType | undefined>(undefined)
```

And in components where I need to use the todo state:

```typescript
const { todos, addTodo, deleteTodo, toggleTodo } = useContext(TodoContext)
```

# **4\. Marking Todos as Complete/Incomplete**

To mark tasks as completed, I added a simple checkbox next to each to-do. When clicked, it calls toggleTodo, which changes the completed status of that todo.

```typescript
function toggleTodo(index: number) {
  setTodos((prevTodos) =>
    prevTodos.map((todo, i) =>
      i === index ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
    )
  )
}
```

This function updates the specific todo without mutating the original array.

# **5\. Deleting Todos**

Deleting a todo is also simple. I used the **filter()** method to remove the todo based on its index in the list.

```typescript
function deleteTodo(index: number) {
  setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((_, i) => i !== index))
}
```

This creates a new array that excludes the deleted todo, and then I update the state with that new array.

# **6\. Downloading the Todo List as CSV**

One cool feature I added was the ability to download the to-do list as a CSV file. Here’s how I did it:

```typescript
const downloadCSV = () => {
  const dataCSV =
    'task,completed\n' +
    todos
      .map(
        (todo) => `${todo.text}, ${todo.completed ? 'done' : 'not completed'}`
      )
      .join('\n')

  const blob = new Blob([dataCSV], { type: 'text/csv' })
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)

  const a = document.createElement('a')
  a.href = url
  a.download = 'todo-list.csv'
  a.click()

  window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
}
```

This code generates a CSV file with the to-do tasks and their completion status, which can be easily downloaded.

# **7\. Optimizing with useMemo**

To avoid unnecessary re-calculations, I used useMemo to optimize the performance when rendering the to-do list. For example, I used it to filter completed and incomplete tasks more efficiently.

```typescript
const renderTodos = useMemo(() => {
    return todos.map((todo, index) => (
      <li key={index} className={styles.todoItem}>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          className={styles.checkbox}
          checked={todo.completed}
          onChange={() => toggleTodo(index)}
        />
        <span className={todo.completed ? styles.completed : styles.todoText}>
          {todo.text}
        </span>
        <button
          className={styles.deleteButton}
          onClick={() => deleteTodo(index)}
        >
          Delete
        </button>
      </li>
    ));
  }, [todos, toggleTodo, deleteTodo]);
```

# **Conclusion:**

Building this application gave me a deep understanding of important concepts like **createContext** and **useContext**. I also understood how **useMemo** works and why we need it. In general, I gained a lot of experience doing this application, and I’m sure that it will help me in my future real-world projects.

If you are new to the **React** world I suggested creating a to-do application and using **createContext** and **useContext**, also add to the to-do application **useMemo**, which gives you a deep understanding of how works, **useMemo** **useContext** and **createContext** functionality.
