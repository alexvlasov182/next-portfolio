# Todo Application with React

I built a **Todo App** using **React** and **TypeScript**. The app lets users **add, delete, complete tasks**, filter them, and **download the list as a CSV file**.  

The difficult part was using **createContext** and **useContext** to manage state across multiple components and **useMemo** to make rendering faster.  

This project helped me understand **React hooks** and **state management**, and I gained practical experience creating a modular, maintainable app.
